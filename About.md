As part of a personal project, I developed a dynamic weather application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app provides real-time weather updates and forecasts, utilizing APIs to fetch accurate data for various locations. The user-friendly interface allows users to search for specific cities or use geolocation to retrieve their current weather. Additionally, I implemented responsive design principles to ensure optimal performance across different devices. This project not only enhanced my front-end development skills but also demonstrated my ability to work with APIs and create engaging user experiences.
